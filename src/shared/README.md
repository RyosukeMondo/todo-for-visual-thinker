# Shared Module

Shared utilities and types used across the application.

## Structure

- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `constants/` - Application constants

## Guidelines

- Keep utilities pure and framework-independent
- Use TypeScript for strong typing
- Write unit tests for all utilities
